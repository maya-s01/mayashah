Hi, I'm Maya, it's nice to meet you!

I am interested in learning more about different coding ${chalk.underline.blue('languages')} and how they work together to create ${chalk.underline.blue('beautiful')} applications.
${chalk.italic.magenta('I\'m familiar with HTML, CSS, Java, and JavaScript.')}
In the future, I think it would be super cool to learn the coding language, Python!  

I believe debugging is an ${chalk.underline.green('extemely')}
important skill to have when coding. Many of the times, 
the output of code doesn't always work out on the first try because of an error in the code. Debgugging takes patience and time, but it's always ${chalk.underline.blue('rewarding')} 
to see the code come together!

To get in contact with me, connect with me on ${chalk.bold.red('LinkedIn')} @ Maya Shah!
